### Topic
- [Linearization of Differential Equations](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ModelLinearization): 3 scripts. Description: Linearization is the process of taking the gradient of a nonlinear function with respect to all variables. It is required for certain types of analysis such as a Bode plot, Laplace transforms, and for State Space analysis.
### Quiz
- [Quiz: Linearize ODEs](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizLinearization): 1 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on linearizing differential equations and transforming the equation into deviation form.
### Assignment
- [Linearization of Differential Equations](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/LinearizeDiffEqns): 4 scripts. Description: Exercises on linearization of nonlinear differential equations. These exercises take the gradient of a nonlinear function with respect to all variables.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Linearize Energy Balance](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabLinearize): 3 scripts. Description: Radiative and Convective Heat Transfer Prediction with a Transistor Heater
