### Topic
- [Optimization Method: SOPDT to Data](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SecondOrderOptimization): 2 scripts. Description: A second-order linear system with time delay is a common empirical description of many dynamic processes. This tutorial demonstrates how to fit an SOPDT model to data with optimization techniques.
