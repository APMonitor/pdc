### Topic
- [Sensors and Signals for Process Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SensorSignals): 0 scripts. Description: Pumps and valves regulate fluid flow and are often the final control element for a process control system. Analog control signals are often sent 3-15 psig levels to valves and sensors return 4-20 mA signals to indicate the fraction of sensor range.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Sensors and Data Acquisition](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizSensors): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on sensors and data acquisition.
### Assignment
- [Transmitter Design Exercise](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SensorDesign): 0 scripts. Description: Sensors convert process conditions into either analog or digital signals. Flow, presssure, level, temperature, and concentration sensors are reviewed.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Temperature Sensor](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabSensor): 3 scripts. Description: Dynamic Temperature Response of a Heater and Temperature Sensor with an Arduino
