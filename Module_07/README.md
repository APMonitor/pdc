### Topic
- [Optimization Method: FOPDT to Data](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/FirstOrderOptimization): 2 scripts. Description: A first-order linear system with time delay is a common empirical description of many dynamic processes. This tutorial demonstrates how to fit an FOPDT model to data or a more complex simulation with optimization techniques.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Parameter Regression](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizFirstOrderRegression): 1 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on optimizing a first-order plus time-delay model to fit data. The model is fit to data by adjusting three parameters to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and measured values.
### Assignment
- [Parameter Regression](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/DynamicParameterRegression): 1 scripts. Description: A first-order linear system with time delay is a common empirical description of many dynamic processes. Optimized regression methods are used to fit a first order system to process data.
### TCLab
- [TCLab FOPDT Regression](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabRegression): 2 scripts. Description: Linear Dynamic Temperature Response Model of a Heater and Temperature Sensor with an Arduino
