### Quiz
- [Quiz on CSTR Case Study](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizReactorControl): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on temperature control of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR).
### Assignment
- [Temperature Control of a Stirred Reactor](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/StirredReactor): 2 scripts. Description: Case study on temperature control in a stirred tank reactor with a PI or PID controller in Python. The exercise involves creating a dynamic first-order model, obtaining tuning parameters, and tuning the controller.
### TCLab
- [TCLab PID Control Tuning](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabPIDControlTuning): 3 scripts. Description: TCLab with proportional integral derivative (PID) control tuning. Tuning a PID controller is the process of finding parameters that improve the controller response to disturbances and setpoint changes.
