### Topic
- [Proportional-only Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ProportionalControl): 0 scripts. Description: Proportional-only control is a less common variant of PID control that does not have an integral or derivative term. It is typically used with integrating processes.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Proportional Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizProportionalControl): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on proportional control as the most basic type of Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Control.
### Assignment
- [Control a Water Tank Level](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TankLevel): 2 scripts. Description: Proportional-only control is a less common variant of PID control that does not have an integral or derivative term. It is typically used with integrating processes such as this tank level control problem.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Proportional-only Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabPOnlyControl): 3 scripts. Description: TCLab with proportional-only control has offset between the setpoint and measured temperature. The purpose of this lab activity is to quantify and verify the offset.
