### Topic
- [Graphical Method: FOPDT to Step Test](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/FirstOrderGraphical): 2 scripts. Description: A first-order linear system with time delay is a common empirical description of many dynamic processes. This Python source code demonstrates how to simulate a step test and compare with an FOPDT approximation.
