### Topic
- [Second Order Systems](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SecondOrderSystems): 1 scripts. Description: A second-order linear system is a common description of many dynamic processes. Overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped second order systems are three classes.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Second Order Graphical Methods](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizSecondOrderSystems): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on second order dynamic system graphical methods.
### Assignment
- [Graphical Method: Second Order Underdamped](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SecondOrderApplications): 1 scripts. Description: Transfer functions (Laplace domain) help analyze dynamic systems. Exercises are to transform a linear differential equation into the Laplace domain and reposition the variables to create a transfer function.
### TCLab
- [TCLab On/Off Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabOnOffControl): 3 scripts. Description: On/off control is used in most cooling and heating applications where the actuator can only be in an On of Off state. The temperature control lab shows the application of On/Off control and fits a 2nd order model to the closed-loop response.
