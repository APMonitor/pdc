### Topic
- [Transfer Functions](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TransferFunctions): 2 scripts. Description: Transfer functions in the Laplace domain help analyze dynamic systems. This introduction shows how to transform a linear differential equation into the Laplace domain and reposition the variables to create a transfer function.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Transfer Functions](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizTransferFunctions): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on transfer function analysis including how to calculate gain, compute input to output relationships, and limitations.
### Assignment
- [Transfer Functions in Block Diagrams](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TransferFunctionBlockDiagrams): 0 scripts. Description: Transfer functions (Laplace domain) help analyze dynamic systems. Exercises are to transform a linear differential equation into the Laplace domain and reposition the variables to create a transfer function.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Block Diagram Analysis](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabBlockDiagram): 5 scripts. Description: Design a controller for automation of temperature regulation to a setpoint. The controller adjusts a heater to regulate the temperature.
