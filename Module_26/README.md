### Topic
- [State Space Models](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/StateSpaceModel): 1 scripts. Description: Linear Time Invariant (LTI) state space models are a linear representation of a dynamic system in either discrete or continuous time. Putting a model into state space form is the basis for many methods in process dynamics and control analysis.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on State Space Models](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizStateSpace): 1 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on state space models.
### Assignment
- [State Space Stirred Reactor](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ReactorStateSpace): 2 scripts. Description: Case study on a stirred tank reactor linearization and modeling in Python. The exercise involves creating a dynamic model based on balance equations, linearizing, and fitting the equations into state space form.
### TCLab
- [TCLab State Space Model](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabStateSpace): 5 scripts. Description: Derive and simulate a state space model of temperature response to heater step changes
