- [Course Schedule](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/CourseSchedule)
### Topic
- [Laplace Transforms](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/LaplaceTransforms): 1 scripts. Description: Transfer functions in the Laplace domain help analyze dynamic systems. This introduction shows how to transform a linear differential equation into the Laplace domain and reposition the variables to create a transfer function.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Laplace Transforms](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizLaplaceTransforms): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on Laplace transforms with Final and Initial Value Theorem.
### Assignment
- [Laplace Transform Applications](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/LaplaceApplications): 2 scripts. Description: Express functions or equations in Laplace form. The Laplace exercises are problem that require knowledge of Laplace transforms to develop analytic expressions important in process dynamics and control.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Impulse Response](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabImpulseResponse): 2 scripts. Description: Laplace Transform solution of a Heater impulse and Temperature dynamic response with an Arduino
