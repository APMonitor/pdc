### Topic
- [Dynamic Simulation in Python](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ModelSimulation): 2 scripts. Description: Three methods to represent differential equations are (1) transfer functions, (2) state space, and (3) semi-explicit differential equation forms. Python is used to simulate a step response in these three forms.
### Quiz
- [Quiz on Higher Order Simulation](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/QuizModelSimulation): 0 scripts. Description: Learning assessment on higher order dynamic system simulation.
### Assignment
- [Distillate Composition Control](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/DistillationControl): 3 scripts. Description: Maintain an overhead mole fraction for the light component in a binary distillation column that separates cyclohexane and n-heptane.
### TCLab
- [TCLab Higher Order Models](https://www.apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TCLabHigherOrder): 5 scripts. Description: Derive and simulate a transfer function, state space, and time series model of T2 temperature response to heater Q1
